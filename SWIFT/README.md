# SWIFT

**SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication)** payments are specially designed for international transfers. If you want to send money between your UK bank account and an account in another country, you’ll usually use SWIFT.

SWIFT is actually a network of banks, each with their own SWIFT code to identify them.

### It’s not the quickest way to make a transfer though, with the average payment taking 1-4 business days. 

The transfer time often depends on where you’re sending to and which banks are involved. Your payment could be routed through several banks on its journey, which takes longer and can cost more.

Speaking of cost, SWIFT payments usually have a fee charged by your bank. And if other banks are involved along the way, you (or your recipient) could pay extra in what is known as correspondent or intermediary bank charges.
