# BACS

**BACS (Bankers Automated Clearing Services)** payments are just ordinary transfers between UK bank accounts. They’re used by personal and business customers everyday.

This type of fee-free payment comes in two types - Direct Debits, and Direct Credits. The upper limit for how much you can send via BACS varies between banks and accounts.

BACS payments usually take up to three business days to clear.¹ So if you need your payment to arrive more quickly, you’ll need to use either CHAPS or Faster Payments.

To send a BACS payment, you’ll usually just need your recipient’s bank account details including sort code.
