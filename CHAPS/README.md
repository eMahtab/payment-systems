# CHAPS

CHAPS (Clearing House Automated Payment System) is a real-time gross settlement payment system used in the UK for sterling transactions, primarily for high-value, same-day payments between banks.

It's essentially a way to transfer money instantly and ensure it's received the same working day. 


## CHAPS payments canâ€™t be reversed.
