# CHAPS

**CHAPS (Clearing House Automated Payment System)** is a real-time gross settlement payment system used in the UK for sterling transactions, primarily for high-value, same-day payments between banks.

It's essentially a way to transfer money instantly and ensure it's received the same working day. 

## ❗❗❗ CHAPS works within UK only.

## ❗❗❗ CHAPS payments can’t be reversed.



### Who uses CHAPS?
Direct participants in CHAPS include the traditional high-street banks and a number of international and custody banks. Many more financial institutions access the system indirectly and make their payments via direct participants. This is known as agency or correspondent banking.

CHAPS payments have several main uses:

* Financial institutions and some of the largest businesses use CHAPS to settle money market and foreign exchange transactions
* Corporates use CHAPS for high value and time-sensitive payments such as to suppliers or for payment of taxes
* CHAPS is commonly used by solicitors and conveyancers to complete housing and other property transactions
* Individuals may use CHAPS to buy high-value items such as a car or pay a deposit for a house
