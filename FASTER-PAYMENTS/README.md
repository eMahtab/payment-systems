# Faster Payments

Faster Payments are near-instant transfers¹ made between UK bank accounts. They’re a relatively new type of transfer in the UK (compared to other bank transfer types), having been introduced in 2008.

# ❗❗❗ It’s one of the most common types of bank transfer for small, everyday payments. 

You can send money with Faster Payments 24/7 and it’ll arrive in the recipient’s account almost instantly. Best of all, you don’t usually have to pay anything extra to make use of the service, and it happens automatically.
